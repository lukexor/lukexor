        <p>Hi. My name is Luke. I reside in Portland, OR working out of a menagerie of coffee shops and pie establishments. I've been tinkering with code since high school when I first learned what HTML was. Oh, what a journey it has been.</p>

        <p>I'm still work with Perl a lot, but I also dabble in just about everything in my spare time including C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Golang, Rust, Swift, and Javascript. I love learning new programming languages and finding the best tool for the job. Over the years I have developed a borderline addiction to problem-solving with many late nights, refusing to go to bed until I was satisfied I had solved the problem or reached an acceptable stopping point.</p>

        <p>I am constantly thirsting for new things to learn and more efficient ways to solve problems including finding problems to solve just for fun. Emerging technologies excite me and I keep looking for what else I can sink my teeth into. I post articles here to share ideas and spur discussions about code, software practices and technology.</p>
