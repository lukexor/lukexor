					Hi. My name is Luke. I reside in Portland, OR working out of a menagerie of coffee shops and pie establishments. I've been tinkering with code (mostly perl at that time) since high school when I first learned what HTML was. Oh, what a journey it has been.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm still mostly developing in perl these days, but also in Python and Objective-C. Over the years I've developed a borderline addiction to problem solving with many late nights refusing to go to bed until I was satisfied I had reached an acceptable stopping point.
				<p>

				<p>
					I'm constantly thirsting for new things to learn and more efficient ways to solve problems. I'm excited about emerging technologies and what else I can sink my teeth into. I blog to share ideas and spur discussions about code and technology.
